Despite being non-literate, his keen observation and emulation of successful agricultural institutes contributed to increased productivity. Recognizing the importance of textile industry and education for the family business, Naidu sent the next generation abroad for exposure, enhancing their knowledge in textiles, engineering, and technology.A deeply religious individual, Naidu spearheaded the renovation of the Karivaradaraja Perumal Kovil and, in an egalitarian gesture, established the Peelamedu Mariamman Temple for those denied entry into mainstream places of worship. His dedication to charity manifested in the original Trust Deed, elevating the PSG Charities beyond a mere institution to a sibling with distinct status.As the bridge among four industrious brothers who committed their time and profits to the welfare of the sibling as per the Trust Deed, Rangaswamy Naidu’s commitment to agriculture, education, and charity embodied the spirit of the PSG Charities in its formative years. His legacy endures through PSG’s hallmark strategy of combining industrial processes with educational development, making it a modern and innovative institution.'
